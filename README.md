# Solitaire++

The best game coded in the best language. 

This was a personal challenge I took on to develop a command prompt game entirely in C++. The entire project probably took around a few hours in total, so excuse the rough edges and watch out for some bugs. 

So yeah, this is a fully functioning solitaire game played entirely in the command prompt. Libraries used include `iostream, string, vector` and a whole lot of conditionals. 

I really enjoyed taking on this challenge and will be trying something similar in the future.
